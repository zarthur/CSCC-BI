Once we've loaded the library, we'll read data from a file located at `http://biws.cscc.arthurneuman.com/wf_fake_balances.csv` and store it in a variable named `balances`. Included in this data set are end-of-month account balances along with other, related data. The type of object used to store our data is known as a *DataFrame*; we'll often use DataFrames to store data when working with pandas. The columns of a DataFrame are *Series* objects.
