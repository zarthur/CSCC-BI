    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "While visualizations can certainly be useful as an aid in story telling, we can also rely on visualizations to help make sense of data when we're exploring it and trying to extract meaning. While an exploratory visualization might make sense as we're working closely with the data, it's meaning could be lost or overwhelming when used as an explanatory tool in a report or summary. An exploratory visualization *could* be used as an explanatory visualization especially if it clearly supports the message that is being conveyed and can be easily understood by the target audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we'll look at the examples of visualizations as both exploratory and explanatory. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Exploratory Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin by exploring a [dataset](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data) provided with the [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) library that contains tip-related data.  The seaborn library provides a high-level interface to the commonly used [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) library ([examples](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/index.html)) that can be used to create more-polished [visualizations](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html). \n",

Next, we'll indicate to the notebook software that we want generated plots to appear in-line as part of the notebook and set the figure size to 12x10 \"inches\"."
