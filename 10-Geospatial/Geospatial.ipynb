For a given address and a set of bus stops, we can calculate the distance to the nearest bus stop.  For a collection of addresses, we can calculate the distance to the nearest stop for each of them.  We can than determine what the greatest distance is from this set of calculations as a way of measuring how accessible public transportation is in an area.\n",
